## Introduction

This project was created with the intention of making developers, both experts and beginners get a basic understanding of some terms used in the programming world.

## Community

## A

- **application (software)**:a program or group of programs designed for end users.s
- **API (application programming interface)**: an intermediary software that allows two or more applications to talk to each other.

## B

- **boolean**: a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false).

## C

- **callback**: a function that is passed as an argument to another and is expected to execute at a given time.
- **class**: a defined structure to create an object in an object-oriented programming language.
- **compiler**: a program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another language.
- **control flow**: the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed.

## D

- **database**: a central location in which data is stored and managed.
- **Data-driven Programming**: A programming paradigm in which the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken.
- **documentation(docs)**: a written text or illustration that accompanies a software which either explains how the software operates or how to use it.

## E

- **ecosystem**: a collection of software projects, which are developed and co-evolve in the same environment.
- **enum**: a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.
- **extension**: a piece of software extends the capabilities of an appliation and adds extra features to an already working standalone application.
- **extension(file)**: a three or four-letter abbreviation that signifies the file type. Eg: `.js .tsx`

## F

- **framework**: a concrete platform where common code with generic functionality can be selectively specialized or overridden by developers or users.
- **float**: a data type composed of a number that is not an integer, because it includes a fraction represented in decimal format.
- **function**: a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.
- **Functional Programming**: A programming paradigm that builds software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

## I

- **IDE(Integrated Development Environment)**: a software application that combines all of the features and tools needed by a software developer.
- **integer(int)**: a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.

## L

- **library**: a single or collection of files, programs, routines, scripts, or functions that can be referenced in another code.
- **list**: a collection type that stores ordered, non-unique elements which allow duplicates.
- **loop**:a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met.

## N

- **null**: a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.

## O

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: A programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

- **operator**: a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.

## P

- **plugin**: _see [extension](#e)_
- **Procedural Programming**: a programming paradigm based upon the concept of procedure calls, in which statements are structured into procedures (also known as subroutines or functions).
- **Programming**: the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
- **Programming Language**: a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. _Eg. JavaScript, Python._
- **Programming Paradigm**: a style or "way" of programming.

# R

- **repository**: a central location in which code is stored and managed.

## S

- **string**: a sequence of characters.
- **syntax**: The grammer of a programming language.

## T

- **type (data type)**: an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

## V

- **Version Control**: a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
